## Repo Organisation


## Project Planning

As mentioned in the report we decided to use a Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology to account for the short amount of time. We can see this manifested in the testing flow:

We also planned our project using a top down design, while prioritising potential features:

Implementing essential features went as planned, with also also implementing some desired features too. See the project timeline below:
