# Server Documentation

AWS was intially used to handle the game server and all API requests required for the cloud to function.
These were implemented via AWS Lambda functions for internal and external requests. External requests are passed through the AWS API gateway, internal requests are called by some of the external functions. Lambda was chosen due to its reliable and simple implementation while offering a cheap solution costing nothing for up to 1 million requests a year. I have written a short summary if each function below:
