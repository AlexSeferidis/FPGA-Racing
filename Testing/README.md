# FPGA # 

**Our raw testing results can be found [here](FPGA/FPGA_Testing_Spreadsheet.xlsx)** - Holds the raw data for our performance metrics described in the report.

The table below has all our FPGA testing videos:

| Video                                                      | Description |
| ---                                                        | ---         |
| [FPGA Testing](https://youtu.be/wZNNn36rBvE?feature=shared)| Testing to check that the client is recieving the accelerometer values from the FPGA            |
| [FPGA-Client Latency](https://youtu.be/r2b-2XCyKpY?feature=shared) | Example test run of testing the time taken for the client to register the FPGA movement |
| [Controller Response](https://youtu.be/zo5X-9E8AXg?feature=shared) | Example test run of testing the time taken for the game to register the FPGA movement|
