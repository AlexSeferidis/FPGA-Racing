# FPGA # 

**Our raw testing results can be found [here](FPGA/FPGA_Testing_Spreadsheet.xlsx)** - Holds the raw data for our performance metrics described in the report.

The table below has all our FPGA testing videos:

| Video                                                      | Description |
| ---                                                        | ---         |
| [FPGA Testing](https://youtu.be/wZNNn36rBvE?feature=shared)| Testing to check that the client is recieving the accelerometer values from the FPGA            |
| [FPGA-Client Latency](https://youtu.be/r2b-2XCyKpY?feature=shared) | Example test run of testing the time taken for the client to register the FPGA movement |
| [Controller Response](https://youtu.be/zo5X-9E8AXg?feature=shared) | Example test run of testing the time taken for the game to register the FPGA movement|

# Server #

Our server side testing was done using **python scripts**. **These scripts and our raw data can be found [here](Server)**

# Game # 

Our game testing mostly involved play testing during real time development and at regular intervals with the whole team. This meant we could consistently give feedback and evaluate how our game was progressing.

The table below has all our Game testing videos:

| Video                                                              | Description |
| ---                                                                | ---         |
| [Game Feature Testing](https://youtu.be/S1cmUIf-zqw?feature=shared)| Testing to ensure that game specific features are working correctly |
